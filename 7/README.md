There was a manatory 24 hour waiting period before this code was released

```
Hike from where morning light is free
Down four then right half of three
The creatures all look to the way
But first 65 paces or you'll be astray
One more than the logs and you're lost in a jiffy
On this path find the man from nineteen fify
It's time to play Frogger to go to behind
Is it arc math? addition? Look to the spines
Where Five from eleven crosses four from twentytwo
This line means zip it's here just to fool
Rhyming's hard now you're in the right place
Wander to and fro till you find the right face
Upside down frogs by logs first found
Then by the feathers then two then pound
```


The escape room was on the second floor of the gateway. 

Entry Code: `4252`

Once in the room there are 9 'games'. Some of the games are non-clues, whereas others are the order of the code. 

For example, 'battleship' has the word 'second' hid in it, That game is at position 3 on the keypad. 

Once you enter the code in the 'safe' it will open a trap door in the wall. 

Crawl through. 

Then inside the room, set the wheel on the wall to the position that says 'mary'. 
Count those colors and enter them on the color coded chest. 

Find the wall with the multiple pictures of marry on the wall (marylynn monroe, marry statue ect..). Play marry had a little lamb on the piano. It will blink a code on the lights. 

Inside the chest, it reads: 

- Lanterns (4)
- Animals (8)
- Frames (7)
- Marrys (3)

Count up all the objects in the room to get the code to the door
