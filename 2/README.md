## Solve

Tintic Tunnel

The lantern blinks tunneltunnel

There is braille that shows tintic in the 2nd half of the video 

I solved it by guessing 'little sahara' based on the africa comment. Which then I identified tintic tunnel by the fact that I was there recently. 

## Challenge

What was the location encoded with?
