When you called you got a voice mail with a recorded message

```
Stop. Don’t divide by me. The Romans didn’t know I’d be in binary. Each day of the week I’m the winning ball. Doesn’t matter what the season. Make a wish so you don’t fall. Play some tic tac toe or a baseball game. What repeats again. Drinks and muscles are the same. He’s under the name Harry Houdini
